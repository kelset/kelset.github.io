I am called Lorenzo Sciandra, and I am a Senior Software Engineer currently working for a small startup - *you probably never heard of it* - called [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) {{< icon "microsoft" >}}. I've been hammering hands on keyboards for almost 8 years now, and been living in London 🇬🇧 for half of it.

When I'm not busy trying to address company-wide, multi-layered problems, I very much enjoy [speaking at conference and meetups](/talks), writing [blogposts](/posts) and in general doing what I can to help and elevate those around me - reason why I'm also a big supporter of mental health and I've been sharing my experience with burnout and going to therapy over the last few years (*you can find some of that in both the [posts](/posts) and [talks](/talks) sections*).

### My involvement in OSS

I've been quite involved in Open Source over the last few years:

* I am one of the maintainers of [`react-native`](https://reactnative.dev/) *(since Jan 2018)*
  * I'm also the author of the main (*almost 100k downloads* 😱) VSCode Extension Pack for `react-native` - unsurprisingly called ["React Native - Full Pack"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack)
* I founded and organised a meetup for maintainers, called ["Provided As Is"](https://github.com/provided-as-is), in London 🇬🇧 - *think of it as kind of a support group for those of us doing OSS*
  * it's current on hiatus because of the pandemic, but if it's something you'd like to attend or help with, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/Kelset)!
* I was in the [2022 OpenUK Honours List](https://openuk.uk/2022HonoursList/) "celebrating the future generations of Open Technology in the UK" - *yeah, I can't believe it either* 🤯
