Personal website ([kelset.dev](https://kelset.dev/)) made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo).

## Contributing

First off, thanks for deciding to work on this codebase! In case you need to test out stuff locally, after git cloning the repo, you need to just run `hugo server`.

This of course implies that your machine is setup to [work with Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and you also need to follow the [installation guide](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/installation/) for the theme (which basically boils down to [installing Go](https://go.dev/dl/)).

### Upgrade the tooling

There are 3 things to keep an eye on for this codebase and each require a few quick steps to update.

- the version of Go - [releases are here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release)
  - *Remember that you also have to install locally the version of Go (via the installer on their website AFAIK).*
- the version of Hugo - [releases are here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
- the version of congo - [releases are here](https://github.com/jpanther/congo/releases)
