## Contributing

First off, thanks for deciding to work on this codebase! In case you need to test out stuff locally, after git cloning the repo, you need to just run `hugo server`.

This of course implies that your machine is setup to [work with Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
