Earlier this week I was talking with another developer about therapy. I wanted to share with them some pointers, and... well, it ended up becoming a wall of text. So I slightly adjusted it and put it here - I hope you can find it useful.

_Please keep in mind that all that's written here is based on my personal experience. If an alternative method or take worked for you, that's great._

## The approach: how to think about therapy if you are a developer

Just like we donâ€™t expect our code to be perfect in the first commit, therapy is an iterative journey. It's about gradually understanding and improving ourselves, not unlike how we refine and enhance our software with each iteration.

Not just that: therapy helps us develop another crucial aspect â€“ emotional intelligence. This balance is key not just for our personal lives, but also in our professional environments: it might not look like it on a surface level, but empathy and understanding play a significant role in team dynamics and leadership.

And remember burnout? You know, that thing that [73% of software engineers have ALREADY EXPERIENCED](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/lifestyle/#mental-well-being)? Well, guess what. Therapy can help with it: can help prevent it and recover from.

It's not a silver bullet, for sure. But it gets pretty damn close if you do it long enough.

## The Proto-question: so, should I get a therapist?

Let's be honest for a second: you clicked on a blogpost with this title. The answer is YES.

The moment that you feel that you are overwhelmed by life, that you can't get out of the pit you fell in, that you are dealing with something that you don't know how to handle... that's the right moment (well, ideally, even before that).

And, if you are a male, then <mark>DOUBLE YES</mark> .

## Getting your ducks in a row

Choosing a therapist is about choosing someone that you will trust and will make you feel safe and not judged, probably more than anyone else in your life. You should be careful in the process of selection. Here are some decisions that I would suggest you take your time pondering on, before starting the actual search.

### Gender Preference

Do you have a preference for a male or female therapist? This choice is deeply personal and can significantly affect your comfort level. For example, I chose a male therapist.

### Language

Which language do you find it easier to express yourself in? For me, it was Italian, but since I often switch to English, I looked for one that could speak both. Ensure your therapist can accommodate your language needs.

### Psychological Approach

Now, the big one: the type of therapy. There are many ([oh, so many](https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-therapy/types-of-therapy/)), each with different methodologies, levels of activity, and focuses. The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/topics/psychotherapy/approaches) categorizes them into five main groups:

- Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies
- Behaviour therapy
- Cognitive therapy
- Humanistic therapy
- Integrative or holistic therapy

Consider researching these approaches to see which resonates with you. One that is very popular in recent years is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT); so maybe you could try that one. My therapist is a Integrative-Relational Psychotherapist.

## Actually finding the therapist

Once you have decided on all the above, it's finally actually time to look for a therapist. It might surprise you, but the best way I've found is to use a good ol' search engine, and find the websites of the single studios or practitioners in my general area. Use those to find someone that aligns with the selections you made ealier - and then then leverage the fact that most therapists offer an initial free session, which is an excellent opportunity to assess compatibility.

Unless there's clear incompatibility right from the get-go, I recommend committing to at least a month of weekly sessions to truly gauge the relationship you are creating with this other person and effectiveness of the therapy type.

If possible, opt for in-person sessions. A physical office can provide a safe and conducive environment for therapy, enhancing the overall experience. I think this is key especially at the start of a therapy journey; once you have created that rapport, you can evaluate doing remote sessions but I've found it hard to find a space as safe and distraction-free.

## The money bit, aka why I said "EASY" in the title

_I'll let you in on a little secret: if you want to trigger a reaction in a software engineer, you have two ways: one is to tell them that something is impossible (and they will go to the end of the world to prove you wrong) or that is easy (and they will not believe you and try to prove you wrong asap)._

Aside from click-baiting you into reading so far, I do actually believe that software engineers do have it easy when it comes to starting therapy: yes, it is usually expensive, but software engineers get paid above average pretty much everywhere (_you can quickly prove - or maybe disprove me, in which case let me know - by googling the average soft eng salary vs average overall salary for a given country_). And, usually, this role comes along with health insurance, which usually means that you can go to them first and they will provide you with the list of practitioners they are able to cover (at least partially).

On top of that, goes without saying, it's also easier because developers know how to surf the web much more easily than most - a great skill to have during the research phase.

All of that said, for those who might find the cost prohibitive, there are charities and associations that offer support: I've added all that I could find in my [Notion board for Mental Health resources](https://lifeiswhat.notion.site/Managing-my-Mental-Health-adb0fb63a8144951b304bfb3bb7ed482). I also really like Anna Akan's suggestions in her video "[If you can't afford therapy, do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYQYaNsr6Jg)".

Remember: prioritizing your mental health is crucial, and there are resources available to help.

## Wrapping Up

Finding the right therapist might initially seem daunting, but itâ€™s actually quite straightforward. Consider your preferences, explore different approaches, and commit to the process â€“ much like how you would approach a new project or learning a new programming language. Itâ€™s one of the most valuable things we can do for ourselves, both as individuals and as professionals in the tech world.

Remember, taking care of our mental health is as important as maintaining the uptime of the systems we build. If you have any questions or need further advice on starting this journey, feel free to reach out.
