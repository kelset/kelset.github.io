Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m a Senior Software Engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) {{< icon "microsoft" >}}, a dedicated maintainer of React Native since 2018, and an advocate for mental health and open-source.

## My Journey 🚀

Born and raised in Italy, I ventured to the vibrant city of London 🇬🇧 over half a decade ago, marking a new chapter in a journey that began with my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino. With a decade's worth of keyboard warriorship, my path in the tech industry has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. From tackling industry-wide challenges to sharing insights at conferences and meetups, my passion lies in uplifting and empowering those around me. My commitment extends beyond technology; I am a staunch advocate for mental health within our industry. Openly sharing my experiences with burnout and therapy, I aim to destigmatize these important conversations and foster a more supportive and understanding tech community.

## Open Source and Beyond 🌐

My commitment to open source is more than just code; it's about fostering a supportive community and driving change. Here's a glimpse of my involvement:

- As a maintainer of [`react-native`](https://reactnative.dev/) since January 2018, I've been involved in many ways in its evolution:
  - 🚀 Released approximately 50 versions of the [`react-native`](https://reactnative.dev/) package, navigating the complexities of various semver minors. The journey from [0.56](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/07/04/releasing-react-native-056) onwards has been nothing short of unpredictable. 🤯
  - 🤝 Co-driven the presence and coordination of Microsoft within the React Native ecosystem. Check out the next section for more.
  - ✨ Authored the prominent VSCode Extension Pack for `react-native`, known as ["React Native - Full Pack"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack), amassing over 100k downloads.
- 🏅 Recognized in the [2022 OpenUK Honours List](https://openuk.uk/2022HonoursList/), celebrating significant contributions to open technology in the UK.
- 🤝 Founded and organized ["Provided As Is"](https://github.com/provided-as-is), a London-based meetup serving as a support network for open-source maintainers.

### Working on ⚙️

Here are some of the things I'm working on at... work 😅:

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which enable you to create awesome cross-platform iOS and Android apps powered by Javascript.
- [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), what if I told you that we can use React Native for Windows as well?
- [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and for macOS too!
- [rnx-kit](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit), some of extra and advanced tools we made at Microsoft to make RN even better!
- [React Native Test App](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app), an iOS-Android-macOS-Windows React Native project without upgrading pains.
