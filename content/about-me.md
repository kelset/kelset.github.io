My name is Lorenzo Sciandra _(he/him)_, and I am a Senior Software Engineer currently working for a smaaaaall startup - _you probably never heard of it_ - called [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) {{< icon "microsoft" >}}. I've been hammering hands on keyboards for almost 10 years now, and been living in London 🇬🇧 for over half a decade.

When I'm not busy trying to address industry-wide, multi-layered challenges, I very much enjoy speaking at conference and meetups, creating content and in general doing what I can to help and elevate those around me - reason why I'm also a big supporter of mental health and I've been sharing my experience with burnout and going to therapy over the last few years.

If you want to learn more about me, please check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-sciandra/){{< icon "linkedin" >}}.

You can also reach out to me [via email](mailto:notkelset@kelset.dev){{< icon "email" >}}, or via [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/kelset){{< icon "twitter" >}}.

### My involvement in Open Source

- I am one of the maintainers of [`react-native`](https://reactnative.dev/) _(since Jan 2018)_
  - I have worked on many aspects of the project, among which I have been the releaser of ~50 versions of the main package across many different semver minors (earliest being [0.57.4](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.57.4)).  _I kind of lost track of the number tbh_ 🤯
  - I have also been co-driving the coordination and presence of Microsoft in the React Native ecosystem, and you can learn more about it in the [official dedicated MSFT DevBlog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/).
  - I am also the author of the main (_100k+ downloads_ 😱) VSCode Extension Pack for `react-native` - uninspiringly called ["React Native - Full Pack"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kelset.rn-full-pack)
- I founded and organised a meetup for maintainers, called ["Provided As Is"](https://github.com/provided-as-is), in London 🇬🇧 - _think of it as kind of a support group for those of us doing OSS_.
  - it's current on hiatus because of the pandemic, but if it's something you'd like to attend or help with, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/Kelset)!
- I was in the [2022 OpenUK Honours List](https://openuk.uk/2022HonoursList/) "celebrating the future generations of Open Technology in the UK" - _yeah, I can't believe it either_ 🤯
