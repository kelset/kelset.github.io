## Bio

Iâ€™m Lorenzo Sciandraâ€”a senior software engineer, technologist, speaker, and advocate for mental health and open source sustainability. Most recently, I contributed to the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/), where I focused on bolstering open-source ecosystems and collaborating with maintainers globally. Before that, I played a pivotal role at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) {{< icon "microsoft" >}} as a senior software engineer within the Microsoft 365 organization, and as part of the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) core team as a maintainer and releaser, leading key initiatives to improve release processes and foster collaboration across the open-source community.

Beyond my work in software, Iâ€™ve dedicated my time to advocating for mental health within the tech industry, hosting the [debug:mind](https://debug-mind.com) podcast to spark conversations about well-being in high-pressure environments. My commitment to open source and community building has been recognized through awards like the OpenUK ["Next Generation Open Technology Leaders"](https://openuk.uk/community/openuk-honours-lists/2022honourslist/) list. Iâ€™m always excited to connect with others passionate about technology and the human side of its creation.

### What's Next

Iâ€™m taking some time to recharge and tackle a long-overdue list of non-work priorities. However, Iâ€™m always open to conversationsâ€”if youâ€™re looking for someone who knows their way around React Native, complex codebases, open-source projects, and life in big tech, letâ€™s chat!
