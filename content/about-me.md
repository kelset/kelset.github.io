## Bio

I'm Lorenzo Sciandraâ€”a senior software engineer who thrives at the intersection of technical excellence and ecosystem-scale impact. Over the past decade, I've built my career around a unique combination: deep engineering expertise, open source leadership, and the ability to drive change across massive developer communities.

As a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) core maintainer and releaser from 2018 to 2024, I helped shape a framework used by millions of developers worldwideâ€”handling 1,000+ issues, authoring 100+ PRs, and leading 20+ releases that directly impacted apps serving hundreds of millions of users. This wasn't just about writing code; it was about orchestrating collaboration between Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and countless community contributors while maintaining the stability of a platform that powers everything from Facebook to major enterprise applications.

At [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/) {{< icon "microsoft" >}}, I operated as both engineer and strategic bridge-builder, driving React Native adoption across Office 365, Outlook, and Skype while fostering partnerships that strengthened the entire ecosystem. I led release stabilization efforts, established cross-company best practices, and represented Microsoft at industry conferencesâ€”work that required equal parts technical depth and stakeholder navigation.

Most recently, I contributed to the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/), focusing on open source sustainability and supporting critical infrastructure projects that underpin the modern web. This role reinforced my belief that technology's greatest impact comes from building systems and communities that scale far beyond any individual contribution.

Beyond the technical work, I'm a passionate advocate for mental health in tech, hosting the [debug:mind](https://debug-mind.com) podcast and speaking at 20+ industry events. I believe our industry's future depends not just on what we build, but how we build itâ€”and who we support along the way. This perspective earned recognition through awards like the OpenUK ["Next Generation Open Technology Leaders"](https://openuk.uk/community/openuk-honours-lists/2022honourslist/) list.

### What's Next

I'm currently collaborating as an independent consultant with startups and established companies, applying my experience in performance optimization, architectural strategy, and open source best practices. I'm also exploring opportunities for my next permanent roleâ€”ideally something that combines technical leadership with broader organizational impact.
