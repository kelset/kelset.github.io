## Introduction

- Begin with your motivation for sharing your process in 2024, highlighting the evolution of tech talks and your passion for contributing to the community.
- Mention your experience and credentials briefly to establish credibility.

Since kicking off my side quest in doing tech talks in January 2019, I've given over 20 talks, learning something new each time. This blog post distills those lessons into a practical guide for crafting tech talks here in 2024. It's the essence of what I've learned from speaking to fellow devs and the feedback loop that's followed.

## My General Approach/Thought Process for a Talk

- Discuss your overarching goal for any talk: to educate, inspire, or solve a problem.
- Highlight the importance of understanding your audience and tailoring your message to their needs and interests.

When I set out to create a tech talk, my starting point is always the audience. What I aim for is a clear, impactful message that resonates well with them, whether it's shedding light on a complex problem, unveiling a novel solution, or simply sharing a journey of discovery in the tech landscape. The goal is not just to inform but to engage and inspire action or further exploration.

To achieve this, I focus on a few key principles:

1. **Relevance:** Ensuring the topic is timely and of interest to the audience. This involves understanding the current trends, challenges, and questions that occupy the minds of my peers.
2. **Clarity:** Breaking down complex ideas into digestible chunks, making the content accessible to everyone, regardless of their expertise level.
3. **Engagement:** Crafting a narrative that not only educates but also entertains, making the learning process a non-dreadful experience.

Each talk is a story, a carefully woven tapestry of insights, experiences, and visions for the future. It's about painting a picture that captivates the audience, drawing them into a world where technology not only solves problems but also opens doors to endless possibilities.

## Creating the Talk - From Idea to Skeleton

- Idea Generation: Reflect on the process of finding a core idea that excites you and is relevant to your audience, utilizing questions and brainstorming techniques to narrow down topics​​.
- Title and Abstract: Emphasize the significance of crafting compelling titles and abstracts to attract the right audience, providing guidelines and examples for effective titles​​.
- Skeleton of Slides: Share how you transition from a broad idea to a structured outline, creating a slide per minute of talk time as a general rule, and segmenting your talk into digestible sections​​.

The journey of creating a talk begins with a spark - an idea that you're eager to share. This idea doesn't just emerge fully formed; it's the result of curiosity, exploration, and a deep dive into subjects that fascinate both you and your potential audience. Here's how I navigate from that initial spark to a structured presentation:

1. **Idea Refinement:** It starts with broad brainstorming, asking, "What message do I want to leave with my audience?" This phase is about refining your idea to ensure it's both engaging and informative.

2. **Understanding the Audience:** Knowing who you're speaking to is crucial. It shapes not just what you say but how you say it. Whether they're beginners or advanced in the field, tailoring your talk to the audience's level makes it more impactful.

3. **Title and Abstract Crafting:** With a clear idea and audience in mind, the next step is creating a compelling title and abstract. These elements are your talk's first impression, so they need to intrigue and inform, promising value to your attendees.

4. **Outline Creation:** Armed with a title and abstract, I sketch a broad outline of the talk. This includes the key points I want to cover, structured in a way that tells a coherent story from introduction to conclusion. This skeleton serves as the foundation for my slides, guiding the development of each section to ensure it contributes to the overall narrative.

5. **Slide Skeleton:** Moving from a general outline to a detailed slide plan, I aim for a balance between content and clarity. Each slide is crafted to convey a single idea, ensuring the talk progresses smoothly and keeps the audience engaged. This stage involves deciding what visual aids, examples, or stories will best illustrate each point.

In creating the skeleton of your talk, remember it's not just about what you say; it's about how you guide your audience through the journey of your presentation. This structured approach helps in delivering a talk that's both informative and memorable.

## From Skeleton to Slides - My Visual Rules

- Discuss your specific rules for slide creation, including design principles for clarity, engagement, and memorability, and software recommendations for reliability​​.

With a solid outline in hand, the next phase is turning that skeleton into a set of slides that will visually captivate and clarify the points I'm trying to make. Here's my approach to slide creation, guided by a few key visual rules:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity:** Each slide focuses on one main idea. Overloading slides with text or complex visuals can dilute the message. Instead, I use clear, concise text and meaningful imagery to reinforce my points.

2. **Consistent Format:** Using a consistent format for slides helps maintain a professional appearance and aids in audience comprehension. This includes a uniform color scheme, font styles, and slide layouts.

3. **Visual Engagement:** To break up the monotony and keep the audience engaged, I incorporate visuals like diagrams, code snippets, and occasional memes (sparingly). These elements are not just decorative; they're integral to explaining concepts and adding moments of light-heartedness.

4. **Readability:** Ensuring slides are easily readable from the back of the room is paramount. This means using large, legible fonts and leaving ample space around text and images. The bottom part of the slide is kept relatively free of content to accommodate visibility from all angles.

5. **Personal Touch:** The first and last slides are personal bookmarks of sorts - introducing me and concluding with a thank you while inviting further connection. These slides include my contact information, reinforcing the opportunity for ongoing dialogue beyond the talk.

6. **Adaptability:** Finally, I prepare by ensuring my slides can be shared and accessed in various formats. This means having a PDF version ready as a backup and for distribution, allowing the audience to revisit the content at their leisure.

Creating slides is a balancing act between conveying information effectively and keeping the audience's attention. By adhering to these visual rules, I aim to create presentations that are not only informative but also engaging and memorable.
