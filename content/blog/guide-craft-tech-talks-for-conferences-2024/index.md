## Introduction

Embarking on my tech talk journey back in January 2019 has been nothing short of an adventure. With over 20 talks under my belt since _(and more coming up)_, each one has been a learning curve, offering invaluable insights. This guide is a distillation of those lessons, tailored for my fellow developers and colleagues, aiming to provide a practical roadmap for crafting (at least) "good enough" talks.

_For a glimpse into my speaking adventures, feel free to visit [my collection](https://kelset.dev/tags/talk/)._

## My Approach to Crafting a Tech Talk

Creating a tech talk for me is akin to storytelling, where the audience's engagement and takeaway are paramount. My strategy revolves around a few core principles:

1. **Relevance:** I make sure the topic resonates with current trends and challenges that my audience faces.
2. **Clarity:** Simplifying complex concepts into bite-sized, understandable pieces is key to accessibility.
3. **Engagement:** I weave a narrative that educates and entertains, making the learning journey enjoyable.

Adding to these, there's a fourth, somewhat "secret" principle guiding my process: ensuring my talks align with my thought patterns. Memorizing talks isn't my forte. Instead, I craft each slide to naturally lead into the next, trusting that the me that wrote the talk and the me on stage think the same way, and that to go from A to B they will do A, F, K, T, B.

Remember: each presentation is a narrative journey, weaving insights and visions, aimed at inspiring and engaging the audience with the endless possibilities technology offers.

## From Idea to Outline

The inception of a talk starts with an idea that sparks curiosity. Here's my process:

1. **Refining the Idea:** I begin with broad brainstorming to fine-tune the core message.
2. **Understanding the Audience:** Tailoring the talk to the audience's knowledge level ensures relevance and impact.
3. **Crafting the Title and Abstract:** These are the first impressions of the talk, needing to intrigue and promise value.
4. **Developing the Outline:** This acts as a blueprint, guiding the creation of content that tells a coherent story.
5. **Planning the Slides:** I focus on a balance of content and clarity, ensuring each slide supports the talk's flow and keeps the audience engaged.

This structured approach aids in crafting a presentation that's both informative and memorable.

## My Rules For Making the Slides

Creating slides for my tech talks once I have the skeleton ready is relatively simple. But, in a way, it's also a complete rewrite; sometimes I might notice that things flow better in a certain way, or that I have to move a few things around to keep the ideas floating. Either way, I do follow a series of specific rules:

- **Timing is Key:** I aim for a slide per minute to maintain a comfortable pace, avoiding overloading the audience with too much information or too many transitions.

- **Choosing the Right Tools:** Preferring offline tools like PowerPoint or Keynote ensures I'm prepared for any internet connectivity issues at conferences.

- **Breaks for Clarity:** Using "title only" slides to segment my talk helps give the audience a moment to process the information, making the overall experience more digestible.

- **A Dash of Humor:** While I enjoy incorporating a meme or two (limiting myself to one per ten slides, circa), it's about striking the right balance between humor and content.

- **Simplicity and Focus:** My slides are straightforward, focusing on the essence of the message with minimal text, making sure the key points stand out.

- **Designing for Visibility:** Ensuring slides are legible from the back of the room is a priority, with a clear font and space at the bottom for better visibility.

- **Personal Branding:** Adding my name or social handle along with the event name on each slide helps in making connections and enhancing recall.

- **Optimal Format:** Adhering to a 16:9 slide format for consistency and compatibility across different screens.

- **Let S Not Live Demo:** Jumping right into the content keeps the momentum going, with pre-recorded demos or animations to explain complex concepts without relying on risky live demos. In other words: don't challenge the live demo gods, unless strictly necessary.

- **Who Am I == Thank You:** The slide where I introduce myself is visually very similar to the last slide, with both my name, contacts and avatar (in the latter I also add links to other resources and the slides, usually). You can't introduce yourself at the start and expect everyone to still remember you at the end!

Once I am happy with the slides and have them ready for stage time, I export a PDF version, to have as backup if something goes horribly wrong at the event. This export also serves another purpose: after having done the talk on stage, I'll upload them to [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/) for easy access and sharing.

Whether you're a seasoned speaker or preparing for your first tech talk, these resources can provide a wealth of knowledge to help you make a lasting impact on your audience.

## Conclusion

While this guide covers the fundamentals of tech talk creation, I deliberately avoided talking about aspects like call for papers, conference selection, and practicing. _If you would like a "part 2" on those topics, let me know._

My hope is that this guide serves as a starting point for you to explore, experiment, and ultimately find your unique voice in the tech speaking circuit. The journey from an idea to the applause at the end of a well-received talk is both challenging and rewarding.

Remember, each talk is an opportunity to share your passion, insights, and discoveries with a community eager to learn. Don't hold back just because you have never done it before - everyone was in your position when they started!

My deepest thanks go to all the conference organizers and attendees who've supported my journey. Your trust and engagement have been invaluable, driving me to grow and contribute more to our community.

## One More Thing

Embracing the spirit of 2024, I've created "Tech Talk Writer Assistant," a custom GPT tool designed to streamline the tech talk crafting process. It embodies my experience and insights into a resource for all - basically, all the things I've written above plus a sparkle of making it help you step-by-step. (and, to be clear, it doesn't use/include the resources I linked as my inspirations: it will only give you the exact same list of links if you ask for more resources)
