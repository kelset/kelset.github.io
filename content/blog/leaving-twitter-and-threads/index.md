_tl;dr: enough is enough, going forward I‚Äôll only use bsky+masto (and linkedin as ‚Äúbackup‚Äù)._

## Intro

Last week has been A WEEK (I mean, it‚Äôs basically been A YEAR or even longer tbh‚Ä¶ ü´†). Quite a few things have happened that scare and concern and make me sad - but exactly because of those, I‚Äôve finally reached a breaking point.

For a while I have been very well aware of how some of the biggest social networks use their algorithms and UX implementation to serve their monetary goals (and if you need a primer, check out [this YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4maJty0vQjI)) - but over the last month, it has become hyper-clear how some of them have been taking ‚Äúpolitical stances‚Äù, and how this all played out, mostly for the worst (imo)([source 1](https://www.platformer.news/x-election-elon-musk-voter-fraud-misinformation/), [source 2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/), [source 3](https://www.usermag.co/p/algorithms-are-making-political-speech)).

With this blogpost I want to share my thoughts and what I‚Äôm doing about that, hoping that it might help you reason about it all in case you have been having my same struggles - and maybe inspire you to take action.

## Current status and what next

So, I think that the best way to talk about this is to start from how I have been using social media, as it might be somewhat different from yours: for starters, I have entirely dedicated/separate accounts for my work/developer persona, in the form of twitter, threads, linkedin, bluesky, mastodon (via Elk) and reddit. _(you can see them all listed in the homepage)_

The second ‚Äúweird‚Äù thing is that I don‚Äôt have the apps on my phone: I only use them via webapps. I can‚Äôt tolerate having the apps, and I only install them in ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù cases like when going to a conference.

The way I create content for them is usually draft them mostly via [Typefully](https://typefully.com/), which is a pretty cool product I like a lot (doesn‚Äôt have bluesky integration‚Ä¶ [yet](https://typefully.canny.io/feature-requests/p/publish-to-bluesky)), and manual copy-paste them and tweak per each platform. _(aside from reddit: I barely use that one, but sometimes it‚Äôs useful for posting links about things to specific subreddits)_

And a side note about [debug:mind](https://debug-mind.com/), my podcast about mental health in tech. It has accounts on threads and twitter and IG and tiktok and youtube (aside from presence on the podcast platforms).

All of that said, to cut to the chase: I decided that going forward I‚Äôll:

- only be active on Mastodon and Bluesky
- turn private and inactive both Threads and Twitter (for debug:mind as well)
- post only the important bits but not be active on Linkedin (and even less on reddit)

## some more whys

Aside from what I wrote at the start about the big picture reasons why I do not want to support anymore Threads and Twitter (by voting with my feet), I wanted to mention some more things that have been bothering me for quite a while on both platforms - I think are annoying enough to keep you off them as a user.

### Twitter sucks

I can‚Äôt think of a platform that exemplifies enshittification quite as much:

- they have been adding half-baked features for a really long time, and most of them are completely pointless and useless (do you know you can post jobs on it?!).
- the changes to blocking and the blue mark are some of the worst things I‚Äôve seen done on a product
- it‚Äôs still very much full of bots: even on my small-ish account (8k+ followers) at least once a week I get spam DMs from bots, and I mean, just look at the [almost 250 followers](https://x.com/debug_mind/followers) of the debug:mind account.
- notifications don‚Äôt even work half the time
- the algo is literally your worst enemy when posting

### Threads sucks

I had some hopes for this one when it started, given the promises of integration with the Fediverse, but since then it‚Äôs been a falloff:

- just like for Twitter, the algo sucks hard. And it‚Äôs easily exploitable: Tom Warren puts it best: [‚ÄúThreads if just full of people stealing content, engagement bait, and grifting. This is why an algorithmic feed sucks.‚Äù](https://www.threads.net/@tomwarrenuk/post/DCL59cZNuBt?xmt=AQGzDL7iZt-FhYVg2xTSipG2G68bG6LC4VsebsdAh4oidA)
- it‚Äôs incomplete: ex. no DMs, and they are lagging behind on their fediverse integration promises
- it‚Äôs called Threads but then doesn‚Äôt let you actually read threads well - there‚Äôs basically no good UX when a someone posts a thread and you want to read it all.
- it miscounts replies. Look [at this example](https://www.threads.net/@kelset.dev/post/DCHJDVcIiQ6?xmt=AQGz_qnevgKKz1L8luFqfS0Whyve5kiLsJ9n0eXoqlMvrQ): it‚Äôs just a 4 parts thread from me, but for some reason it‚Äôs counting the items of the thread as replies.
- some stuff doesn‚Äôt work at all - like, a while back [I pinned this tweet](https://www.threads.net/@kelset.dev/post/C90MKTqIlbk?xmt=AQGz_qnevgKKz1L8luFqfS0Whyve5kiLsJ9n0eXoqlMvrQ). And now I can‚Äôt figure out how to unpin it, the option is not there anymore. _(my next best guess is a mobile-app-only-feature which UUUUUUUGH)_
- fake notifications to pull you back, like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a tweet you might like‚Äù or ‚Äúthis person is active!‚Äù

### Mastodon and bsky are‚Ä¶ good-ish

The reasons why I want to keep using those as primary going forward are multifaceded for sure, and I still have a few reservations with both platforms. Mastodon is an OG of the microblogging space, and while getting into it might seem daunting, after finding your server and app (personally, I like [Elk](https://elk.zone) for web and [IceCubes](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp) for iOS) I think the Fediverse is pretty cool. I also know a bit some of the people driving the Mastodon project and I think they are great humans.

About Bluesky I have mixed feelings, and I know in the past I didn‚Äôt see it succeed - but things have changed: they have stepped up their game, moderation is in a good spot, and there are all the features you might want from twitter replacement, and even more! But most of all what convinces me, right now, is that the engineers are not only active on the platform, but also reactive and listen to their community. Not the PMs, the marketing people: the engineers. When the coders are as involved and passionate, it‚Äôs IMHO a good sign that a product is healthy.

And both of them are open source and free from ads!

> in case you want to read a better primer on Mastodon, Bluesky and Threads, the Electronic Frontier Foundation [wrote a great blogpost](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/whats-difference-between-mastodon-bluesky-and-threads) that also explains in better details some of the things I mentioned.

## some resources in case you want to do the same (or similar)

At this point, I think I blabbered enough about the why - let‚Äôs talk about the how here for a second.

First off, if you want to remove Twitter: here‚Äôs [a complete guide](https://www.theverge.com/24293448/x-twitter-musk-deactivate-how-to) by The Verge. And here‚Äôs [a tool](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback) in case you want to publish your old tweets in a public archieve, like [Andy Bell did here](https://bsky.app/profile/bell.bz/post/3la7m64nab725).

If you want to get started with Mastodon: [here‚Äôs a great list of resources](https://mementomori.social/the-mastodon-list/) that will cover everything you might want to know (from what it is, to tools to use to migrate, to how to find new people to follow, ‚Ä¶).

About Bluesky, most of the resources out there focus on migrating from Twitter to Bluesky, and for that I think [this website is the current best option](https://www.bluesky-migrate.com/). And here‚Äôs a guide from the EFF [about bsky‚Äôs moderation tools](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/how-clean-your-bluesky-feed).

One thing about bsky is that it has this concept of a Starter Pack, which is great to quickly find accounts to follow - here‚Äôs [a directory with all of them](https://blueskydirectory.com/starter-packs/all). I made one myself with people from [all over the OSS world](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/kelset.dev/3l7vrkvoxh225).

(and for those of you who miss TweetDeck, here you go: [BlueSky alternative](https://deck.blue/), [Mastodon alternative](https://mastodeck.com/) - I don‚Äôt use them, I can‚Äôt deal with multi-column, but I‚Äôm sure some of you find it mandatory)

### the extra mile

Around the time last week when the world felt much more bad and in pain and sad, the OpenUK team had [a virtual meetup](https://www.meetup.com/openuk/events/303912333/) about the topic of IndieWeb, hosted by the wonderful humans [Lorna Mitchell](https://lornajane.net/) and [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/) with [Ana Rodrigues](https://ohhelloana.blog/) and [Ryan Calum](https://calumryan.com/) as speakers. I was not very familiar with the concept, but Ana and Ryan did a great job at introducing [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) the movement/website/etc.

I think that, in the long run, we should go even more towards that idea of ‚Äú_owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content_‚Äù. (and in case you want to read more about it, here are a couple of articles about it: [one](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2024/201/s1/peckham_digital/) and [two](https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/one-year-in-the-indieweb))

I think Mastodon and bsky allow you to take your first few steps in that direction.

And for good measure, for an extra mile on the extra mile, in case you are growing more concerned about bigtech owning your stuff and your overall privacy, here‚Äôs the [PrivacyGuide](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) and [OptOutProject](https://www.optoutproject.net/) websites.

## closing off

Took me a while to write this up and take action - I had a lot to digest and feel and think through. The next few years are going to be a rollercoaster to say the least, and I feel we need to do what we can to feel as much as peace with the situation we live in as we can.

Focus on what you can control.

Breathe.

And keep going. Time is an arrow.
