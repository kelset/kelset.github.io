_I realized that I've been fully remote for more than 3 years now, collaborating weekly with teammates from all corners of the globe, from Seattle to Oslo to Bangalore. Being part of such a diverse and widespread team offers a unique set of challenges and rewards._

### The Pros

1. **Not Having To Commute:** Ditching the daily commute, especially in a city like London where "just around the corner" is a 40-minute journey, is a massive gain. It translates to more personal time, reduced stress, and a smaller carbon footprint.

1. **Working With A Global Team:** Despite the occasional cultural faux pas, working with people from around the world is a unique opportunity to broaden your perspective, learn new approaches, and foster creativity.

1. **Flexible Working Hours:** The autonomy to structure your day brings unparalleled flexibility. It allows for a healthier balance between work and personal life, offering the freedom to work when you're most productive.

### The Cons

1. **Not Having To Commute:** While skipping the commute is a blessing, the lack of daily human interaction can feel isolating. Those impromptu coffee breaks and watercooler moments? Surprisingly missed.

2. **Working With A Global Team:** Working with a global team is enriching but comes with its own set of challenges. Misunderstandings can arise, from differing communication styles to being "ghosted" by colleagues in different time zones.

3. **Flexible Working Hours:** The freedom to set your own hours is a double-edged sword. It offers flexibility but requires significant adaptation to align with global teammates. For instance, a 7pm meeting might be just another work hour for someone in Spain but could clash with social norms in the UK, where the workday typically winds down (_read: everyone goes to the pub_) by 6pm.

_But this is just my slice of the remote work pie. I'm well aware that if you ask ten other people about their remote working experiences, you'd likely get ten different stories. Wanna share yours? Reach out on any of the socials below._
