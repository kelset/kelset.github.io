_Sooooooooooo... I‚Äôve been wrestling with this retrospective for two months now. I wanted it out by the end of January, but, welp, here we are. After ~3~ ~4~ 5 completely different drafts I couldn‚Äôt settle on a single, perfect structure, so I rolled back to a pretty basic flow: first my personal reflections, then the practical stuff on how to create a podcast._

## Part 1: Looking Back, How Do I Feel?

...I think I‚Äôm happy with how ‚Äúdebug:mind‚Äù turned out.

I did it for two reasons: first, I felt we needed more open conversations about mental health in tech and wanted to play my part in destigmatizing the topic. Now that I look back, I can say I‚Äôve left a small imprint on something that matters. Second, I challenged myself to release an episode every month in 2024. Despite everything else going on in my life, I managed to pull it off - which feels very rewarding.

### The numbers section

Now, if we look at the numbers, there were [14 full episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y) and 64 shorts, with around 18.3K total YouTube views and 218 subscribers. That might not wow everyone, but as a fresh YouTube account with 0 subscribers, it‚Äôs not bad. The [pilot episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkHoK235CI&list=PLiD6R_aXkpLiMfS2YrhSgtSj09JJCaP2y&index=16)‚Äîreleased on World Mental Health Day 2023‚Äîhit 825 views, which is still the highest to date. But more than the stats, I‚Äôm especially proud of the diversity in our conversations and guests. Of the 14 episodes, five featured people from underrepresented groups in tech, which is still fairly good, though I wish I could‚Äôve done more. We also covered a wide range of mental health experiences‚Äîfrom PTSD and autism to ADHD and depression‚Äîand while a few episodes fell through when guests pulled back or never replied, I did my best to keep things inclusive overall.

Side note: I recently ran across a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250213-youtube-at-20-a-computer-that-drunk-dials-online-videos-reveals-statistics-that-google-doesnt-want-you-to-know) that points out most YouTube videos get fewer than 500 views‚Äî4% never see a single play. That perspective makes me feel even better about where I landed, even if my numbers aren‚Äôt massive in the grand scheme.

### Two quick spicy takes

1Ô∏è‚É£ During the last year and a half, I‚Äôve been trying to stay more tuned-in to mental health conversations in tech, but it never feels like enough. It‚Äôs not fun or clickbaity content; it‚Äôs often difficult and sad, and you need people who are willing to open up and be vulnerable. That‚Äôs not exactly a majority mindset in this space. But after 10+ years in tech, I just keep seeing more and more people struggling (burnout, depression, you name it) all the time, and I wish we did more to address it.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If you‚Äôre trying to get your name out there in the tech world, I highly recommend skipping the whole podcast route‚Äî**do open source instead**. I‚Äôve been in open source for years, and it‚Äôs night-and-day compared to the ‚Äúexposure‚Äù you get from a podcast. Open source is more impactful, builds ~actual~ stronger credibility, and opens doors in a way that a scrappy podcast just can‚Äôt. Make your podcast a fun side project if you really want to, but if your main goal is to grow your profile, open source is where it‚Äôs at.

### All in all

Sure, maybe the name ‚Äúdebug:mind‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the best for SEO. Sure, I‚Äôd probably tweak a few things if I started again. But overall, I‚Äôve done something I believe in: I‚Äôve put a spotlight‚Äîhowever small‚Äîon mental health in our industry. And that‚Äôs enough for me.

I‚Äôll keep the door open for a possible Season 2 if there‚Äôs enough demand‚Äîor even a chance to step into a producer role for other projects (_do reach out if you have a podcast and would like me to help out_).

For now, I‚Äôm just happy this project happened, and it will now exists as-is out there in the wild.

## Part 2: The Practical Bits. If You Want To Podcast, Read This

In general, podcasting is a marathon, so set a sustainable approach and don‚Äôt be afraid to adapt and evolve over time. Now, about things to do:

### 0) Define Your Purpose and Format

- **Know Your Why**: Before doing anything else, you need a clear goal for your podcast‚Äîthat‚Äôs what will keep you going even when things get tough. Pick a focus you‚Äôre passionate about‚Äîmine was mental health in tech‚Äîand that commitment will help you push through.
- **Choose Your Format**: Decide if you‚Äôll stick to audio-only or tackle video. Video can look more polished-that‚Äôs kind of what all the big shots are doing now- but typically involves higher costs (gear, studio rental, dedicated softwares or apps) and a narrower guest pool.
- **Nail the Name**: Just like in programming, naming is a big problem. Keep it short, avoid punctuation or numbers, and if you can lock it down before Episode 1, you‚Äôll spare yourself a world of trouble.

### 1) Pre-Production

- **Build a Pipeline and Stay Organized**: Scheduling guests, choosing topics, editing, and distributing episodes can get messy fast. Use a central planning tool (like [Notion](https://www.notion.so)) to track guests, topics, and release dates. I maintained multiple Notion databases to handle long-form and short-form content separately‚Äîshort-form entries referenced the corresponding long-form ones. This DB also tracked guests and each production stage so nothing fell through the cracks.
- **Frequency and Buffer**: Pick a target release schedule (weekly, monthly, etc.) and keep one or two episodes completed in advance to avoid scrambling. Ex. If it‚Äôs month #2, try to have episode #3 fully finished and ready to go.
- **Finding Guests (If You Want Them)**: Start with people you already know who fit your show‚Äôs theme. Don‚Äôt take it personally if they say no. You can also cold email or message folks outside your network, but be prepared for many to ignore you. Keep multiple leads; guests can drop out at any point. Some may need workplace permission‚Äîespecially in larger companies‚Äîso ask early.
- **Working with Guests**: Once someone agrees, host a quick pre-recording call to finalize topics and expectations. Use a shared doc (like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/)) to coordinate asynchronously and gather discussion points. If you‚Äôre recording remotely, encourage guests to capture their own audio (and video) locally for higher quality. Always keep a backup plan for cancellations.
- **Plan Titles & Visuals Early**: Algorithms can be unforgiving, so don‚Äôt wait until post-production to think about thumbnails, titles, and descriptions. Brainstorm them with your outline so you can tailor your conversation, angles, or visuals as needed. Strong visuals, strategic keywords, and concise copy can significantly boost engagement.
- **Gear and Budget**: Start with a decent microphone‚Äîaudiences can forgive less-than-stellar video but rarely bad audio (I used an [Elgato Wave:3](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/wave-3-black)). If you plan to record in person, factor in possible studio costs. Above all, aim for clarity and consistency in your setup.

### 2) Production

- **Episode Structure**: Strive for a consistent length. Open with a quick intro and outline of what‚Äôs coming, then dive into the main conversation. Wrap up with clear calls to action‚Äîasking listeners to subscribe, leave comments, or share. A predictable format makes your podcast more approachable.
- **Use a Shared Outline**: Reuse your prep doc during recording to keep track of key points, opening lines, and any must-say phrases. If you‚Äôre on video, consider printing the outline or placing it out of frame so you‚Äôre not constantly glancing off-screen.
- **Guest Setup Guidelines**: Provide simple instructions for guests on camera framing, mic positioning, and audio checks. Even if you know your own gear, your guests might be new to recording. A short ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù guide can dramatically improve overall quality. If you‚Äôd like to see an example, reach out!
- **Session Timing**: Schedule the recording to be longer than the final episode. Spend 10‚Äì15 minutes warming up, testing audio, and getting everyone comfortable. After you wrap, allow time to chat off-record‚Äîthank them, ensure they had a good experience, and confirm next steps.

### 3) Post-Production & Distribution

- **Editing and Tools**: Editing often takes longer than expected. I used [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) for my full video edits and to produce an audio-only version from the same project. If you‚Äôre going purely audio, simpler tools like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) or [GarageBand](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/garageband/id408709785) should work well. For short clips, I‚Äôd pull selected segments from the final episode and assemble them in the [CapCut webapp](https://www.capcut.com/editor), rather than importing the entire project. Keep your workflow simple at first (especially if you are not experienced with the tools), then refine as you go.
- **Distribution**: Use platforms that suit your audience. YouTube is great for discoverability, while Spotify and similar outlets covers the audio crowd ([Spotify for Podcasters](https://creators.spotify.com/features/podcast) offers a free tool to distribute across multiple platforms, so I used that). Consider short-form clips on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts to expand your reach. You can also use a scheduling tool like Buffer to keep posts consistent.
- **Interaction with Your Audience**: Build dedicated social media accounts for your podcast on relevant platforms. At least announce new episodes, and if you want to go the extra mile share behind-the-scenes tidbits, and respond to comments or questions. Encourage listeners to subscribe, comment, and share your content‚Äîgenuine engagement fosters a sense of community and helps you stand out (_yes, it‚Äôs redundant and generic AF but honestly the algo is your worst enemy_).
- **Consider a Website**: If you have extra funds, consider building a simple podcast website for credibility and an easy reference point. This can also serve as a hub for show notes, additional resources, or behind-the-scenes content, rounding out your overall online presence. _(s/o to [Adam Ridovics](https://www.adamridovics.com) for making a super cool design for the [debug mind website](https://debug-mind.com)!)_
