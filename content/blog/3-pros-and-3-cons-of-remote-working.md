_I realized that I've been full remote for more 3 years, working on a weekly basis with teammates from all over the world, from Seattle to Oslo to Bangalore. Being remote with such a widespread team is unique and challenging._

### The Cons

**Not Having To Commute:** While skipping the commute is a blessing, the lack of daily human interaction can feel isolating. Those impromptu coffee breaks and watercooler moments? Surprisingly missed.

**Working With A Global Team:** Working with a global team is enriching but comes with its own set of challenges. Misunderstandings can arise, from differing communication styles to being "ghosted" by colleagues in different time zones.

**Flexible Working Hours:** Yes, you can set your hours, but this freedom often means adapting your schedule to accommodate team members across the globe. A meeting at 7pm? If you are in the UK means missing local social norms, like leaving work at 6pm for pub time - if you are in Spain, that's no big deal since people have dinner around 10pm.

### The Pros

**Not Having To Commute:** The absence of a commute has been a major quality-of-life boost. Living in London where going anywhere takes 40 minutes, not having to go through that twice means more time for personal pursuits, less stress, and an environmentally friendlier daily routine.

**Working With A Global Team:** Despite the occasional cultural faux pas, working with people from around the world is a unique opportunity to broaden your perspective, learn new approaches, and foster creativity.

**Flexible Working Hours:** The autonomy to structure your day brings unparalleled flexibility. It allows for a healthier balance between work and personal life, offering the freedom to work when you're most productive.
