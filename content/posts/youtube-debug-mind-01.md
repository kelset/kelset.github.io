summary: "In this episode of 'debug:mind' (formerly 'Untitled Mental Health Project') I dive into the often overlooked realm of mental health in tech. Joined by Nathan Walker (aka 'wwwalkerrun', Principal Software Engineer at nstudio and maintainer of Nativescript), we share our personal journeys and the critical importance of addressing mental wellness within our industry. We explore the power of vulnerability, the impact of work-life balance, and practical self-care strategies. Our goal is to spark conversations, reduce stigma, and encourage a culture of empathy and support in tech."
