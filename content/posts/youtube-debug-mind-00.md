summary: "In this DEBUT episode of 'debug:mind' (formerly 'Untitled Mental Health Project') - made for world mental health day 2023 - I, alongside Roberto (aka 'empijei', ex-Google engineer specialised in webspecs and infosec) , dive into the seldom-discussed but crucial topic of mental health in the tech industry by answering questions from our followers. We share personal experiences, tackle the effects of hustle culture, and offer strategies for achieving a healthier work-life balance.
